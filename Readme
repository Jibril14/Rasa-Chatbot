Rasa Chatbot

# I Change my folder structure at this point (In preparation to dockerise this project)
# at this point my rasa project is half dockerise ie the chat interactive endpoint is dockerise remaining the action server


## steps
- inside chatbot folder I added a dockerfile, which is the main instruction at this point, cus I am yet to use volume
- I will later use docker compose & volume for easy command and to persist data
- Inside the dockerfile i pull the official rasa image, I commented out requirements.txt wanted to pull python:3.9 
- base image and build my own rasa image from scratch but later decided to use the official Image cus of easy use
- and some basic configuration for models volume
- docker build -t chitchat . # Chitchat is what I name my image (ie rasa base image & my files)
- docker run --name myrasachatbot --rm -p 8000:5005 chitchat # create my container and expose port 5005 to reach it
- Was able to reach rasa endpoint from my fastapi through: http://localhost:8000/webhooks/rest/webhook
- chat everything still work fine except rasa action server, which I'm yet to configure
- http://localhost:8000/version : a get request from browser to my docker container still work
- hard refresh the fastapi browser to ensure it point to the chat endpoint
- at this point the models train and sit fine in the container
- this is a workable dockerization steps for the interactive chat endpoint, though without using docker compose


## Dockerizing the action server
- A basic configuration for Rasa action server dockerization (without using auth, compose file etc)
- I use the dockerfile inside of the actions folder
- first I pull the base Image rasa/rasa-sdk:3.7.0 from docker hub, though version should have been 3.6 to match rasa
- add my action file, my action server does not have any other requirement apart from rasa sdk
- I expose port 5055 and spine up a container
- docker build -t rasa-action .
- docker run --name actions --rm -p 5055:5055 rasa-action
- docker container inspect actions
- after running : docker container inspect actions
- I figured this container will listen to IP address from 172.17.0.3
- That means for my chat container to communicate with this actions server container
- I have to change the action_endpoint inside endpoint file to http://172.17.0.3:5055/webhook
- This mean I had to rebuild another chat image, cus of the changes to my code
- By chat image or chat container, I mean my rasa codes (nlu, domain, story files) apart from actions folder
- this setup means I now have two docker containers that communicate with each other
- my rasa chatbot now work perfectly fine, I havent dockerize my fastapi yet, but still able to
- talk to the containers. Everything work fine at this point
- next will be to use compose for a more elegant setup
- also dockerize my fastapi and it database
