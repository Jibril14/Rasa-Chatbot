Rasa Chatbot


## Runing the project at this point (ie the Rasa part only to see Rasa form in action)
- Navigate to project root directory and run:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
cmd
open two terminal for Rasa action & Rasa interaction
- `rasa run actions`
- `rasa interactive`

- rasa run actions: Starts an action server using the Rasa SDK
- rasa interactive: Starts an interactive learning session and chatting to your assistant.

This allow us to see the active_loop of the form, the slots filled and the next action performed after it has 
been filled


# Wnen buy_laptop intent is trigger (we ask bot related ques)
# the rule 'Activate Laptop Form' now trigger the first_laptop_form
# The form now become active as a loop
# The 2nd rule 'Submit Laptop Form' will run on condition that first_laptop_form is active
# We call the action first_laptop_form, which make the form to collect 3 slots as define in the domain.yml 
# Each call to this form run the custom validation and validate the slot collected, NB (we inherit FormValidationAction)
# first_laptop_form is deactivated after all slots have been fill
# Initially we use story.yml to give conversation flow, now we use the slots to influence the conversation
# Now we define the flow under action: in domain.yml. the form look for a specific slot eg laptop_os
# inside the slot, we ask it to influence the conversation, this means it will look for action/message
# that ends with it name e.g utter_ask_laptop_os ie "laptop_os"
# rules dispatch 2 actions after form become inactive
- action: utter_action_submit
- action: utter_laptop_slots

# the above only worked on rasa interactive & not in rasa shell
