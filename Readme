Rasa Chatbot

# I Change my folder structure at this point (In preparation to dockerise this project)
# at this point my rasa project is half dockerise ie the chat interactive endpoint is dockerise remaining the action server


## steps
- inside chatbot folder I added a dockerfile, which is the main instruction at this point, cus I am yet to use volume
- I will later use docker compose & volume for easy command and to persist data
- Inside the dockerfile i pull the official rasa image, I commented out requirements.txt wanted to pull python:3.9 
- base image and build my own rasa image from scratch but later decided to use the official Image cus of easy use
- and some basic configuration for models volume
- docker build -t chitchat . # Chitchat is what I name my image (ie rasa base image & my files)
- docker run --name myrasachatbot --rm -p 8000:5005 chitchat # create my container and expose port 5005 to reach it
- Was able to reach rasa endpoint from my fastapi through: http://localhost:8000/webhooks/rest/webhook
- chat everything still work fine except rasa action server, which I'm yet to configure
- http://localhost:8000/version : a get request from browser to my docker container still work
- hard refresh the fastapi browser to ensure it point to the chat endpoint
- at this point the models train and sit fine in the container
- this is a workable dockerization steps for the interactive chat endpoint, though without using docker compose
